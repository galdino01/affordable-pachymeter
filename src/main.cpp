* Libraries in this project:
* 	- HCSR04 > Developed by: ejoyneering
*   - Talkie > Developed by: Joachimsmeyer
*
* Used equipments:
*	- Arduino Uno R3
*	- HCSR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
*	- 4 male/female cables
*   - 2 male/male cables
*	- 2 cables with alligator connectors on all ends
*   - Speaker with USB cable and P2 cable
*	- Some coffee...
*
* About:
*	This project is an idea to transform reading data into audio format 
*	so that people with low vision can understand what is transmitted. 
*	This code is completely open and can be modified and improved.
*	I just ask that if you are going to use it, say that the source is here. 
*	Thank you immensely.
